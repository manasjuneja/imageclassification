# CIFAR-10 Image Classification from Scratch (NumPy Only)

## Overview

This project implements a simple neural network **from scratch** (using only NumPy) to classify images from **three classes** of the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
**No pre-trained models, TensorFlow, or PyTorch are used.**  
All forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent steps are implemented manually.

## Features

- ✅ Manual neural network implementation (NumPy only)  
- ✅ 3-class CIFAR-10 classification (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird)  
- ✅ Custom training loop with loss curve plotting  
- ✅ Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
- ✅ Platform-independent: runs on any CPU (no GPU required)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### 2. Download CIFAR-10 Dataset

   Download the CIFAR-10 Python version

   Extract it and place the cifar-10-batches-py folder inside a data/ directory in your project root:

cifar10_numpy_classification/data/cifar-10-batches-py/

### 3. Run Training and Evaluation

```
python main.py
```
   This will train the model and then evaluate it on the test set.

   You will see printed metrics and generated plots:

   

 - loss_curve.png (training loss curve)
   
     
 - confusion_matrix.png (confusion matrix)
      
    
 - model_weights.npz (saved model weights)

Model Architecture

    Input Layer: 3072 units (32x32x3 RGB image, flattened)

    Hidden Layer 1: 128 units, ReLU activation

    Hidden Layer 2: 64 units, ReLU activation

    Output Layer: 3 units, Softmax activation (one per class)

Evaluation Metrics

    Accuracy: Should exceed 60% on the test set

    Precision, Recall, F1-score: Printed per class

    Confusion Matrix: Plotted and saved as an image

## Notes

    🧠 No GPU required: All computations run on CPU

    📦 No deep learning frameworks: Only NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are used

    📊 Training set size: 15,000 images (3 classes × 5,000 images each)

    🧪 Test set size: 3,000 images (3 classes × 1,000 images each)

# Analysis

This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network from scratch for image classification. Despite its simplicity and lack of convolutional layers, the model can achieve over 60% accuracy on three CIFAR-10 classes. Most misclassifications occur between visually similar classes, which is expected given the architecture.

This project is ideal for educational purposes and understanding the fundamentals of neural networks without relying on black-box frameworks.
